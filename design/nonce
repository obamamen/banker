have 2 nonces per socket, 1 for incoming, 1 for outgoing.

    only increment on a full packet send or received,

    why 2?

    otherwise when they send at the same time they both increment their nonce's and they wont match up:
    A : 28
    b : 28

    a sends with 28 nonce++, b sends with 28 nonce++.

    and with 2 they can have:
    A : 18, 12
    b : 12, 18

    A sends packet with 18++, and if B send with their nonce it will use the 12 and they still match up.
    they need nonces for both direction.
